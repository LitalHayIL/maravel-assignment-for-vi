### Install dependencies

Before starting to code, don't forget to install all dependencies.



Initialize a new Node.js project with the following command:


```shell
npm init -y
```

Install Express.js as a dependency:


```shell
npm install express
```

To run your server, execute the following command in your terminal:

```shell
node index.js
```


Your web server is now running, and you can access the endpoint using a tool like curl or Postman:

```shell
curl "http://localhost:3000/moviesPerActor?actorName=Robert%20Downey%20Jr."
```
